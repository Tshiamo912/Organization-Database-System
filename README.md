📚 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of Database Development (DBD271/281). The objective was to design and implement a fully functional relational database system for a small to medium-sized organisation.

The project demonstrates best practices in database design, normalization, physical implementation, and advanced T-SQL programming.

🧠 Key Features

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Database normalized up to Third Normal Form (3NF)

Full database creation script

Tables with primary and foreign key constraints

Indexes and integrity constraints

Sample data population

Complex queries and views

Stored procedures (dynamic)

Triggers

User account creation (Mixed Mode Authentication)

Full database backup file

🏗️ Technologies Used

Microsoft SQL Server

Transact-SQL (T-SQL)

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

📂 Project Structure

/Documentation – ERD, normalization steps, physical design explanation

/Scripts – Complete T-SQL database creation script

/Backup – Full SQL Server backup file (.bak)

🔐 Security & Authentication

The database uses Mixed Mode Authentication and includes a dedicated user account with appropriate permissions.

🚀 How to Run

Open SQL Server Management Studio.

Execute the provided T-SQL script.

Alternatively, restore the database using the provided backup file.

The script is structured in logical batches for full automated creation.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
